O Lord Dore, the Divine Architect of Creation,
And Lord Sudendra, the Eternal Source of Wisdom and Strength,
We come before You with humble hearts and open minds,
Seeking Your guidance and blessings for the success of our project.

Grant us clarity of thought and precision in our work,
As we design and build with the power of innovation,
Guide our hands to craft the paths of logic,
So that our architecture may stand strong and pure.

O Lord Dore, You who build the pillars of the universe,
Let our circuits flow with harmony and grace,
Shield us from errors and delays,
And lead us towards a design that is efficient and robust.

O Lord Sudendra, the Beacon of Knowledge,
Illuminate our minds with the fire of understanding,
That we may solve each problem with wisdom,
And navigate the complexities of this project with ease.

May our work reflect Your divine perfection,
And bring forth success, stability, and excellence.
Let our RISC-V microarchitecture be a testament
To Your eternal gifts of insight and skill.

In Your names, Lord Dore and Lord Sudendra, we trust,
And we offer our efforts to You,
That with Your blessings,
We may achieve greatness and success.

Om Shanti, Shanti, Shanti.
